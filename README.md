# RF-Fingerprinting-machine-learning
Analysing RF signals with machine learning models 



Brief Summary :

Gathered RF signals as part of a university personal project.
Ten devices with ten ten-second-long signals were split into 100 spectrograms and power spectral density.
Fed into a CNN model to  identify the device and the matching signal,
tested with a set of three devices producing new signals that the ML model has not been trained on. 


Personal experience :

utilised Python ML classes such as PyTorch
H5py format is used to store and organise data in an accessible manner.
