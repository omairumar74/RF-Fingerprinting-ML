# RF-Fingerprinting-machine-learning
Analysing RF signals with machine learning models 



Overview :

Gathered RF signals as part of a university personal project.  
Ten devices with ten ten-second-long signals were split into 100 spectrograms and power spectral density.   
Fed into a CNN model to  identify the device and the matching signal,
tested with a set of three devices producing new signals that the ML model has not been trained on. 
Radio fingerprinting is a new and emerging field with potential applications in wireless communications. 


Features :

Predict which device is producing the RF signal  
Clean and Preprocess RF signals  
Utilises CNN model functions to analyze Spectograms and power spectral density  
HDF5 format for data storage, allowing ease of use and modularity   
modular components allowing the addition of other ML Models
